# Dungeons & Dragons & Diners & Drive-Ins & Dives

`Play your characters like you're driving a stolen car - Avery`

> Welcome to Dungeons & Dragons & Diners & Drive-Ins & Dives, or D5 has I like to call it. A game that mixes magic with mushrooms and 
fantasy with fantastic taste ( or so I hope ). This system is inspired by or based on the Powered By the Apocalypse system. It's my 
first time using the system so I don't know which term is technically correct, but it probably won't get me sued.

>## The Basics
> ### Dice
> For every single roll in D5 you will be using at most 4 six sided dice. When you have *Advantage*, you roll 3 dice and take the highest two rolls. *Disadvantage* works in the same way, but you take the lowest 2 rolls instead.
>
> ### Rolling
> Unlike in Dungeons and Dragons, where you roll and try to beat some number that the DM has decided, in D5 there are only 3 results and they follow this pattern:
> - 6 or less is a failure
> - 7 - 9 is a mixed success
> - 10+ is a total success
> ### Stats
> The world of D5 is based off of 3 groups of stats, one for your more tangible traits and one for the less so, and a set of "fixed" traits. The highest value any stat in group A or B can be is +3.
>
> **Physical (A)**
> - Might
> - Dexterity
> - Constitution
>
> **Emotional (B)** 
> - Mind
> - Spirit
> - X-Factor
>
> **Other (C)**
> - Speed
> - Health
>
> These stats are combined together for you to perform any action you can think of. There are a lot of ways to use these stats that I'll get into later, but in the end, every thing is at the 
> discretion of the DM. Don't be afraid to talk it out with them.
> The clear outlier here is X-Factor. This is your wild card value. It's your luck, your flair, your steeze, whenever you want to add some pizazz to a roll, this is what you use. 

> ## Building your character
> ### Baseline
> | Stat | Baseline Value |
> |-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
> | Speed | Everyone starts off with a base speed of 30 |
> | Health | Everyone starts off with 7 health |
> | Physical & Emotional | Pick one of each stat group to be +1 |
> 
>
> ## Race
> There are all sorts of people that live in the world of D5, each with their own advantages and strengths as well as some drawbacks.
> | Race | Stat Boosts | Stat Reductions |
> |-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
> | Human | +1 to any stat in group A or B | - |
> | Elf | +2 to mind | -1 to Strength & X-Factor |
> | Dwarf | +1 to Strength & Constitution | -5 in speed |
> | Halfling | +1 in Dexterity & Spirit | -5 in speed |
> | Orc | +1 to Strength & +2 in Health | -1 in Dexterity & Mind |
> | Elemental | +1 to Mind, Spirit, X-Factor | -1 in Strength, Constitution and Health |
> | Nymph | +1 to any magical roll | -1 in Strength and Health |
>
> ### Tailoring your stats
> There are a few general categories you can use to customize your character and they are pretty simple. You have 1 available slots for customizing your stats and can choose any of the following:
>
> | Category | Bonuses | Applicable To |
> | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
> | Stat Specialist | +1 to one stat in a group and -1 to another one in the same group | AB |
> | Group Generalist | take +1 to two stats in a group and -2 to the remaining stat in that group | AB |
> | Group Specialist | Take +2 to one stat and +1 to one group, -2 to one stat in the other group and -1 to the other two | AB |
> | Fast | Gain +10 to your base speed | C |
> | Sturdy | Gain +2 to your base health | C |
> | Magician | See section down below for how magic works | - |


> ### Magicians ###
> Magic is based on either Mind or Spirit and require a roll in that category in order to complete the spell. Upon becoming a magician, you incurs the following costs:
> - -1 to Health or Constitution
> 
> And the following benefits:
> - +1 to Mind or Spirit
> - Gain access to 3 types of magic listed below
>
> **Illusion (M)** magic is the school of generating illusions. These illusions have 3 aspects, perceived, felt and heard. For every level of success you add another one of these to your illusion.
> - Failure: your illusion can be perceived, felt or heard. 
> - Mixes Success: you can have 2 of the 3 aspects. 
> - Total Success: you can have all three (yes, that means on a 10+ you can conjure an item, person animal or whatever). 
>
>These illusions are confined to a 10 X 10 size and depending on the complexity of the illusion, may require additional rolls. For example, if you wanted to conjure a bike, you might need to complete a Mind roll as well to see how well you understand the workings of a bike and how good one of you can make. If you are attacked (take harm) or otherwise distracted (scared/surprised) with you are in the middle of an illusion, you must roll a 7+ Mind roll to continue the illusion.
>
>**Transmutation (M)** is the school of making one thing of another. There are 3 levels of transmuting, rearranging, refining and transforming. Each requires another level of success and enough material components to make the object you are trying to make. You can't make an ocean out of a puddle. An example of transmutation would be if you had a 10 food piece of wood and rolled to transmute it. 
> - Failure: you could reshape how the wood is formed, making something like a bow.
> - Mixed Success: you could refine the wood into a wood product like paper, charcoal or even combustible wood vapor. 
> - Complete Success: you could completely change the wood into another material completely like steel or even gold, and shape it. Only an object that has undergone this highest stage of transformation can be transmuted again. Any lower rolls renders the object alchemically inâ‰¥ert. 
>
>Transmutation preserves the density of an object. If you were to transmute a 5 lbs bag of flour into gold, you would have 5 lbs of gold, not the volume of gold that the bag of flour occupied. More complex transmutations may require additional rolls to test your knowledge of the specifics. All transmuted objects must be one sold component. If you wanted to make a car by transmutation, you would need to transmute every individual component.
>
> **Offensive (M)** is the art of weaponizing your magic. This can be used in diverse ways, such as creating a force, immolation or freezing items. The following types of offense can be used in this school of magic:
> - Basic Elemental: such as casting a fire ball, ice shard or lightning bolt. Using the right kind of magic against an opponent can either strengthen or weaken your magic at the discretion of your DM.
> - Force: Create a localized force. The larger the area of the force, the weaker it is. If you were to create a wall of force the size of a door, it might feel like a strong shove. If the force is the size of a baseball, it might break bones or cause internal damage. If it's a pinprick, it would be like being shot with a bullet.
>
>Rolls work as follows:
>
> - Failure: you can not control your attack and some bad side effect will happen. 
> - Mixed Success: your attack will land, but that's all.
> - Total Success: you can either inflict an extra harm on your attack, or impose some condition on the target with the DM's approval. For example, a 10+ roll on a fireball could set the target on fire, giving it an extra harm every term it remains on fire. 
>
> **Defensive (S)** magic is used to prevent harm. It works pretty simply. Twice per round, when damage is dealt to you a someone within sight and hearing you can try to stop it.
> - Failure: harm dealt is capped at 1
> - Mixed Success: up to 2 points of harm are blocked on a single attack
> - Total Success: damage is completely blocked and can be redirected back to the attacker for 1 harm
> 
> **Healing (S)** magic does simply that. Rolling less than a 6 will result in 1 harm being healed from the target. 7 - 9 means up to 3 points of heal distributed across targets as you see fit. a 10+ means either 5 points of healing or rectify recently dealt (DM's discretion of what *recent* means) serious harm.
>
> **Divination (S)** gives you hints about the future or past. With divination you can take the following actions: 
> - Connect with object: Learn something about an object but touching it
> - Connect with dead: Try and connect with the spirit of a deceased person
> - Read the future: Try and see events as they will happen
> - Read the vibe: See into a person's feelings, or motivations, or get the sense of a crowd
>
> Rolls are as follows:
> - Failure: message is very cryptic, but you know a feeling
> - Mixed Success: message is vague, but helpful
> - Total Success: a very clear message
>
> Connecting with dead will summon the spirit back, but the worse the roll, the more disoriented the spirit will be. 
>
> **Enchantment (S)** is the crafting of magical items to empower or protect you. This is a very open field to invest in and the DM can decide whether you can make certain items or not. They will also tell you the requirements to create something, but each item should take at least 3 components. Some times ideas may be:
> - An amulet that stores a charge of 2 heals
> - A ring that gives you premonitions of danger
> - Shoes that give you +5 speed
> - A bracelet that can give one instance of advantage if given the right materials
>
> Rolls work as follows:
> - Failure: Failed to create the item. Some components may be ruined
> - Mixed Success: 7 - 9 item is created, but maybe has limited uses
> - Total Success: item is created as intended

> # Contests
> Most of the world of D5 takes place in open interaction, where there is a collaborative effort of the players and DM to create a story together. There are times though when the game needs to become more structured and move into a structured mode. These sections of the game are called contests. A more simple contest may be trying to decern if someone is trying to lie to you, with each player only making one roll. These contests are resolved simply by whoever rolled higher. A more complex contest though may be a fight or a cooking competition. These may require many rounds and rolls.
>
> ## Initiative
> To determine initiative order, each player will roll all 3 die, with the highest score going first and everyone following in numerical order. If there needs to be a tire breaker, take the player with the higher speed stat. If they are sill tied, the two players will have another roll to see who goes first out of the two of them. Any player with priority will jump to the front of the order. If 2 players have equal priority then they will do the same 3 dice roll to break the tie.
>
> **Priority** is given at the DM's discretion or by an ability or item the player is holding. Every players's priority can stack, so a player with an item and situational priority could have a priority of +2, beating out anyone with priority of +1.
>
> ## Food
> It wouldn't be true to it's roots if the game didn't have baked in rules about food competitions. There will be many times you may need to cook, bake or mix to impress. Every competition should have at least 3 elements and include more if the DM thinks it needs them. For example, if it was a cake baking competition, there would be a mixing, baking and frosting phase, possibly with a construction phase too. Since everyone is competing at once, there's no real need for turns, the DM will decide how they are to be organized. Speed is important in situations where there are limited resources. For example, if the judges want a spicy dish, and there are only 3 peppers that grant a +1 to your cooking roll, the 3 players with the fastest speed can will get the first choice of using those ingredients. Priority can play a big part here too. For what rolls to use during competition, see the *Combined Rolls* section.
>
> ## Fighting
> While fighting, combatants take turns attacking very similarly to Dnd. Every turn in combat can do the following: 
> - Move
> - Main Action
> - Free Actions
>
> **Moving** is mostly determined by your Speed and Might. There are things that can make movement more difficult though. You can not move through things, you must go around them. The only exception is friendly people in the area. The ways you can move are:
> - Running/walking: up to your movement speed in feet
> - Vertical jump: 2 feet, with an extra 2 feet for every value above 1 in Might
> - Horizontal jump: 3 feet, with an extra 3 feet for every value above 1 in Might
> - Running Jump: 4 feet, with an extra 4 feet for every value above 1 in Might
> - Climbing: 1/3 your movement speed
> - Swimming: 10 Feet per turn, +5 feet per value above 1 in Might
>
> Moving through difficult terrain halves your movement speed. Should you be knocked prone you must use 10 feet of movement to stand up.
>
> **Main Actions** are a set of mutually exclusive actions that you can take on your turn, meaning you get 1 main action a turn. Main actions include:
> | Action Name | Description |
> | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------| 
> | Making a physical attack | Attacking using a weapon or your fists. If you're attacking with an item, use the skill that the item prescribes. If you're using your fists, use your strength |
> | Casting a spell | See the description for our spell |
> | Sprinting | Double your movement speed, but you can't make an attack this turn |
> | Hiding | Attempt to hide yourself from detection using what cover there is around you |
> | Disengaging | Get away from a an attack without taking an opportunity attack |
>
> ### Doing Damage
> If making a physical attack or attacking using a weapon, the results of the rolls are as follows: 
> - 6 or less: Attack misses.
> - 7 - 9: Attack lands and deals 1 harm.
> - 10+: Attack lands and either does 3 harm or 1 harm and inflicts some extra effect the DM agrees to. You can discuss with the DM before you make your decision.
> - Perfect Roll: 3 harm and extra effect.
> 
> ### Taking Damage
> As you damage racks up, it starts to take it's toll. You can take damage until 5 less than your total health without effect.  If you take more than that your attacks take a -1 penalty. If you take 3 less than your total health, there will be some serious effect. For example, if you had 7 health and took 5 damage your character would have some serious effect. Whether that is losing use in their arm for a while or limping for a while while you recover. These effect wear off at the DM's discretion, but it probably shouldn't be more than an extra session or 2. Should you take all points of damage you fall into critical condition. If you start your turn in critical condition, you must roll a single die to see if you survive. If you roll 3 - 6 nothing happens and you survive this turn. If you roll a 1 or a 2, you mark one death fail. If you get 2 death fails, you die. Should your allies heal you for 1 harm, you stabilize and do not need to make any more saving throws, but do not remove harm from your character. If they heal you for 2 or more harm, you regain consciousness and can resume action, removing 1 harm from your character. If you're attack while you are unconscious, you die instantly. 
>
> ### Recovering Damage
> With each long rest (overnight rest of 6+ hours), you regain half of your current harm, rounded up with a minimum of 1. For example, if you were at 6 harm and took a long rest, you would remove 3 harm for that night. The next night you would, with 3 harm you would recover 2 more harm. And then the 3rd night you would recover the last of your health. 

>## Combining Rolls
> Some rolls require multiple attributes to complete. These rolls are made by picking the two attributes bonuses and adding a 3rd die to the roll. If you have advantage or disadvantage, you roll 4 die and take the appropriate highest or lowest 3. The new success ranges are:
> - Failure: 3 - 8
> - Mixed Success: 9 - 14
> - Complete Success: 15+
>
> Some common combined rolls may be:
> - Cooking: Mind, Dexterity
> - Baking: Spirit, Dexterity
> - Brewing: Spirit, X-Factor
> - Decorating a dish: Dexterity X-Factor
> - Magical hybrids
> 
> You can also have advantage and disadvantage on these rolls, in which case you would increase the dice you roll to 4, and take the highest/lowest of those rolls.

> ## Items
> Items are up to the discretion of the DM, but here are some guidelines for how you can create powerful, yet fair items:
>
> **Common Items**
> - Allows a player to attack with a different stat than strength
> - Gives a +1 to the stat the player attacks with
> - Can heal for up to 2 harm
> - Can stabilize a downed person
> 
> **Uncommon Items**
> - Grants +5 speed, or +1 to any other stat
> - Heal up to 4 harm
> - Grants Advantage
>
> **Rare Items**
> - Gives +2 to attack stat
> - Allows the player to attack with a different stat and +1 to that stat
> - Gives Priority in initiative
>
> **Legendary Items**
> - Gives +3 to an attack stat
> - Fully heals a character
>
> These are just some ideas for items. Really, anything and everything can be added by the DM and the players as long as they agree.

> ## Leveling Up
> In D5, there are only 5 levels and you level up from failures. When you fail a task, mark one failure for your sheet. You start at level 0 and level up at the following milestones
> - 1 : 5 failures
> - 2 : 6 failures
> - 3 : 7 failures
> - 4 : 8 failures
> - 5 : 8 failures
> 
> Each new level DOES NOT include previous failures. So after you level up to level 1, you need 6 more failures to reach level 2. On a level up, you can either take +1 to any stat in group A or B or a feat from the table below:
> | Feat | Description |
> | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
> | Faster | +5 to speed |
> | Cat Like Reflexes | Gain 1 charge of priority you can use once per day |
> | Lucky | If you roll all 1's, you can reroll the dice |
> | Innate Magic | Learn 1 extra form of magic, even if you're not a magician |
> | Rally | Once per day, you can grant your allies +1 to their rolls on their next turn |
> | Relentless | Instead of going down when your health hits 0, stay up for one more attack |
> | Surge | 2 times per day you can take 2 Main Actions in your turn |
> | Reckless | Once per turn, you can make an extra attack, but all those attacking you next turn have advantage on attacks against you |
> | Bastion | If you do not move on your turn, you can attack twice |
> | Helpful | You can
